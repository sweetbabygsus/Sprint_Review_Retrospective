# Sprint_Review_Retrospective
CS250 Final Project

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  Being able to listen and take feedback from a customer assits in the process of creating user stories.  Once you have official completed a meeting
  with the customer and possible actual users, you get a better look and understanding of what they would like you to build for them.  It will also help 
  you in identifying the problem and how you can fix it.  Creating user stories gives you a visual on each feature that needs to be created.  Not only 
  does it make you aware of everything that is needed, you also get the importance and see what the actual features do and how it can benefit the user.  
  It also allows the developer and team to identify which user story will need the most labor to complete and be able to adjust accordingly.  
  
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I will move forward with a Scrum agile apporach to future devlopment.  I would like to incorporate this moving forward becasue it is the most transparent
  approach amongst all concepts.  The Scrum allows for all teams to be aware of everything going on and having communication streamlined.  This will 
  hopefully make sure there is no confusion amongst the team and it allows for further teamwork to be the work culture. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  To be a good team member you need to be able to adapt to change as it is inevitable.  Secondly you will need to have proper communciation skills, this
  will help get your point across or ask for support when needed.  Lastly being a good team member is being and inidivdual who can take proper feedback
  when it is given and actually get better from it rather than take it in the wrong way.
